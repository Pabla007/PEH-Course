<title>What is Happening here </title>
</head><body>We have a Windows Server and Connected 2 windows users to it. (i.e. The Punisher and Peter Parker)<br/>
<br/>
Fcastle is a local user but administrator in both the PC's where on the other hand pparker is just a local user which has not admin rights.<br/>
And the security of pparker is handled by the organization (i.e. we have turned it off) but it is not the case of fcastle.<br/>
