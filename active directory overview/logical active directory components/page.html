<title> Logical Active Directory Components</title>
</head><body>What is Active Directory Schema ?_?<br/>
- U can think of it as blueprint or rule book.<br/>

<br/>
What are Domains ?_?<br/>
Used to group things together.<br/>
<img height="310" src="image 2.png" width="400"/><br/>
<br/>
What are Tree's ?_?<br/>
It is a group of domains.<br/>
U have a parent and the children and they share namespace and they share some trust b/w them.<br/>

<br/>
What is a Forest ?_?<br/>
It is a collection of tree's.<br/>
<img height="257" src="image 4.png" width="300"/><br/>
<br/>
Inside of a AD there are somethind called as Organizational Units (OUs)<br/>
<img height="320" src="image 5.png" width="400"/><br/>
<br/>
Trust ?_?<br/>
how we have access b/w resources <br/>
<img height="260" src="image 6.png" width="350"/><br/>
<br/>
Lastly we have Objects ?_?<br/>
Objects is what is going to be inside of our Ous <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Domains -&gt; Trees -&gt; Forests -&gt; Trust<br/>
  |<br/>
  V<br/>
 Ous -&gt; Objects<br/>
<br/>
So let's break it down one more time we have <br/>
Domains (i.e.used to group and manage objects in an organization) <br/>
<br/>
If we have multiple Domains we have what is called as Tree (i.e. it might have Parent domain and might have a Children domain) <br/>
<br/>
When we have multiple sets of Tress we have something called Forest<br/>
<br/>
Iside of this domains we have something called as Ous <br/>
<br/>
And these Ous consist of objects.<br/>
<br/>
Across Forest or Across Domain we have what is called as Trust<br/>
And this Trust could be Directional (One Domain Trust another Domain)<br/>
or it could be Transitive (i.e. One domain trust another domain and than Trust everything else that domain also trust's )</body></html>
