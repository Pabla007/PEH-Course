Very Important Active Directory Component is Domain Controller (i.e. It is the Head Honcho of all the Servers)<br/>
- It host our phone book (i.e. it has all the information on the User's , the Computer's or what printer's are in the Network etc.....)<br/>
- When we attack an internal network (i.e. it's very very bad if compromise your Domain Controller Cuz that means we can comprise the whole network)<br/>

<br/>
Big Take away from Active Directory Data Stors is it holds a file name Ntds.dit (i.e. very sensrive file Cuz when we comprise a Domain Controller we will want to Grab this file)<br/>
Why to Grab this File ?_?<br/>
Cuz it has Password Hashes of All the Users (i.e. we can take them offline and try to Crack them or can attempt Pass the Hash attack or attempt the Golden Ticket attack)<br/>
