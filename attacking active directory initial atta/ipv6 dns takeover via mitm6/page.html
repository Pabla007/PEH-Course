<title>IPv6 DNS Takeover via mitm6</title>
</head><body>We to set the domain using the mitm6 <br/>
<b>Command : mitm6 -d marvel.local</b><br/>
where d stands for domain <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also have to setup a relay attack <br/>
-6 stands for IVP6<br/>
-t stands for target will point to our domain controller's ip address<br/>
and we have configured the certificate so that we can use ldaps<br/>

We have to reboot our windows 10 machine (i.e. the punisher in our case) to trigger the event and will wait for something before we login as ADMIN<br/>
We can see it is trying to Enumerate user's privileges which we take a while and domain info is dumped into Lootdir <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We succeded with an computer and the computer were able to accessing the domain controller via Ldaps logging into it and dumpping any useful information to us.<br/>
Now we will login into a computer (i.e. an admin login to a computer) and was able to make user there.<br/>

We got a new user made for us and can see the user name and password above but they have set up the policy for us to have exclusive priveliges for the access control <br/>

<br/>
It stores the aclpwn here so that we can restore the acl for what it was before <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This is a fantastic attack and it's not the only thing it can do (i.e. we can ot only add a new user but can also add a new user)<br/>
