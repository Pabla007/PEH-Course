The server Name is Hackme and the user by mistake writes hackm which caused a DNS issue <br/>
So will send a broadcast message if anyone knows about it. And we who are listening in the network (i.e. Man In The Middle Attack)<br/>
So this is what LLMNR is we are listening in the middle and the request happens we are just waiting for a response to happen (i.e. user name and hash)<br/>
Will run a tool called <b>RESPONDER<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b><b>Responder is a part of IMPACKET tool kit.</b><br/>
<br/>
Mentor's Strategy:<br/>
Always run this tool first in the morning or right after lunch Cuz as u need a lot of traffic (i.e. Start this before any Nmap scans or Nessus etc....)<br/>
<br/>
Running Responder :<br/>

<br/>
After running responder an event occures : Somebody entered a wrong network drive (i.e. Failed to do DNS) <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And when the event occurs this is what we will get: after we get this hash will try to crack it.<br/>

<br/>
Will use a tool called Hashcat. The more powerful Graphic Card we have the more fast will be able to crack the password.<br/>
So where-ever we go to work they will have a Password Rigs to do this task.<br/>
