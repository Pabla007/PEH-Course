<title>IPv6 Attack Defenses
</title>
</head><body>If IPV isn't enabled in the network then guess what ?_?<br/>
We can't be na IPV6 DNS server because there's nothing for us to do<br/>
<br/>
So disabling IPV6 can have unwanted side effects:<br/>
Will define some block rules instead of allow rules when we have our firewall <br/>
<br/>
If not using wpad then have to disable it using group policy<br/>
<br/>
If we are able to do delegate access against a machine then we can know just <br/>
abuse that feature against the machine<br/>
<br/>
We can cut the head off by disabling IPV6 but best practise says hey you know <br/>
we should actually just do some block rules in the firewall <br/>
