Now we know the attacks how do we piece it together and my thoughts are that we begin the day with man in the middle 6 or responder as we want traffic to be <br/>
generated we need those users coming in <br/>
<br/>
So 8:00 am is a good time when users are starting to come in or even after lunch<br/>
when they're starting to log back in.<br/>
<br/>
If our scans are taking too long if you have a big network which it can happen so we have to look for websites that are in scope.<br/>
We're trying to be quiet as opposed to just like running scans if our goal is to be quiet in the network.<br/>
<br/>
For that will use a module called http_version which we can search in metasploit<br/>
and will see if anything responds to http version when i send out an Http request from my computer.<br/>
<br/>
And it's less likely to get picked up Cuz we are making traffic on 80 and 443 which is very common.<br/>
