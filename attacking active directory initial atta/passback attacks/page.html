<br/>
Think about the pass-back attack<br/>
You will be in situations where u have literally been on engagements and there's<br/>
nothing else out there except printers that u can somehow log into.<br/>
As we never no what's going to work out for us <br/>
<br/>
So the weirdest little default credential could open up a Pandora's box and<br/>
get you into all kinds of Mischief and fun<br/>
<br/>
So don't forget about the Passback attack when you are doing your Active Directory or Internal pentest engagements.<br/>
