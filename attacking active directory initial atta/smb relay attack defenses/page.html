It's reported that it's about a 15 percent or so decrease in speed on file transfers when you're running with SMB<br/>
So that SMB signing does cause a little bit longer time period but Longer time period for computer security is worth the trade off<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However if curb growth stops working as the authentication method then Windows is going to default back to NTLM anyway.<br/>
So it's not a fail safe completly <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Big think to talk about :<br/>
- SMB signing should be diabled<br/>
- Local admin shoud be restricted<br/>
and other are just best practice sort of things but still don't completely eliminate the attack.</body></html>
