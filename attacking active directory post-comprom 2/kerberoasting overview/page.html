<br/>
In this domain controller is also known as a key distribution center (KDC):<br/>
We also have our user which need's to authenticate to the Domain COntroller and when they do they are going to say that they request what is known as a Ticket Grantinh ticket aka NTLM hash<br/>
<br/>
Any valid user (i.e. doesn't have to be admin) gets this ticket this is the authentication.<br/>
We have Fcastle and valid password Password1 which means valid tickey granting ticket.<br/>
<br/>
Will use GetUserSPNs from Impacket Tool kit.<br/>
<img height="409" src="image 2.png" width="600"/><br/>
So this service here has what is called <b>SPN</b>that us a service principal name.<br/>
KDC doesn't know that we have access to this server or not and provide us with TGS and this is where the kerberoasting stops.<br/>
