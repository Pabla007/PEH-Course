<title> Pass the Hash / Password Overview</title>
</head><body><img height="364" src="image.png" width="650"/><br/>
There is a tool that we're going to use called &quot;<b>crackmapexec</b>&quot;<br/>
It takes the username domain and password and throws that password all around the subnet here.<br/>
<br/>

So playing off the different example of past the hash let's say that we have a &quot;psexec&quot;<br/>
here which we get on to this machine and we run a hash stump.<br/>
<br/>
Will take the hash dump of FCastle as shown in the figure and capture the last bit (i.e. NTLM hash) and will try to pass that around.<br/>
User : Fcastle which is a local user.<br/>
<br/>
As u can see we didn't have any luck on this one but <span style="background-color: #ffa300"><b>these local accounts are very dangerous. </b></span><br/>
The issue is a lot of administrator will reuse the same account and password to set up machines. <br/>
<br/>
<b>So looking into these local hashes/ these local accounts are <span style="background-color: #ffa300">super important</span>as well.</b><br/>
