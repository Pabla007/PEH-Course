You could see that it came through it tried this username and password on Hydra-DC it didn't work.<br/>
That means this user does not have SMB access cuz this is trying to access SMB here. Which means it doesn't have access to domain controller.<br/>

How useful is passing the password is ?_?<br/>
This is if I get credential, the very first thing i'm doing is <br/>
I'm passing it around the network because i know it's valid.<br/>
<br/>
You can also utilize this and the password spray but i would recommenf against doing that on domain accounts because what happens is:<br/>
Say if we have 50 machines here and could take this username and can put any password you want here and try to spray it acrss the network.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Local account don't have the lockedout policy like domain accounts do.</b><br/>
If you got stuck in not getting anywhere or if you've come across some different passwords.<br/>
