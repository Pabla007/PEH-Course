<title>Token Impersonation Mitigation</title>
</head><body><b>Account tiering:</b><br/>
Your account administrators should be logging into the machines that they need to access which should only be domain controllers.<br/>
<br/>
If for some reason that domain administrator logs into a user computer or a server and that user computer or that servers get compromised. <br/>
We can impersonate that token if we compromised the domain controller.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Local Admin Restriction:</b><br/>
Local admin comes into play yet again if users are not local admins on their computers we cannot get a shell on that computer with their account that prevents us from getting onto the computer and utlizing this kind of attack.<br/>
<br/>
<b>For example user might have 2 accounts in account tiering:</b><br/>
Bob abd Bob_A <br/>
Bob will have his everyday regualt user account and then when he wants to go access the Domain Controller he's gona log in as bob_a and he's only going to log in the Domain Controller and isloate his accounts with this hearing.<br/>
<br/>
So something to think about in terms of defeating this and it's just<b>beating a dead horse </b>in a lot of this right.</body></html>
