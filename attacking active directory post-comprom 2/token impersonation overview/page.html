When it came's down to moving laterally and there's always potential difference in a new machine.<br/>
From one machine we were Frank Castle and there's nothing great we passed that password.<br/>
And we get onto machine two (i.e. Spider Man) and there is the administrator just sitting there with a token and then we imperosnate that token and then we are now a domain administrator.<br/>
