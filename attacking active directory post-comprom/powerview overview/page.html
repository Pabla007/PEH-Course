Take this file and bring it to one of the windows 10 machine. As we are going to run PowerView which is a Powershell type Script and we are going to run it and do<br/>
enumeration with it.<br/>
<br/>
In an Attacker situation say we have access to a shell then we are going to use that shell and load powershell.<br/>
<br/>
Difference b/w running the script on the machine and on the shell<br/>
<br/>
Will have the option of autocomplete which we will not be having in the shell <br/>
