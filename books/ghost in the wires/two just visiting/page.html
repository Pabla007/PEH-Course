</head><body>He demonstrated how he could have people call him without revealing his real phone number by using a phone company test circuit called a “<span style="background-color: #ffa300"><b>loop-around</b></span>”; he would call in on one of the loop’s<br/>

When two parties call into the looparound, by dialing the respective numbers, they are magically joined together as if they called each other.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn’t be going back into a telephone company facility again anytime soon, but I was keen to find something else—something big—to challenge my <b>ingenuity</b>.<br/>
