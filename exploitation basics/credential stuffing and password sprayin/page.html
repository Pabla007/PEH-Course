</title>
</head><body>This May be Asked in an Interveiw as well so be prepared ...............................<br/>
<br/>
What is Credential Stuffing ?<br/>
-<b>Injected breached account credentials in hope of account takeover.</b><br/>
<br/>
- The art of Credential Stuffing is taking these passwords and usernames &amp; throughing them out on a website and will <br/>
 just spray and pray.<br/>
- Go to firefox and install a plugin called foxy proxy<br/>
- In that go to OPTIONS and add a proxy on the left side.<br/>
- Add the details as shown in the photo below <br/>
<br/>
- Run the proxy. (i.e. Super simple instead of going in the setting and changing the settings. It's an easy on and off)<br/>
- Click on Intercept off and go to Tesla website and click on the account/sign in button on the RHS of the upper corner.<br/>
- Simply fill the fake email and password and click on the intercept buttion -&gt; right click and send to intruder<br/>
- Go in Positions tab and press the clear button and add the position for email and password and change the attack to pitchfork <br/>
- Go in Payload tab and paste the user name in 1 and password in 2<br/>
- Will start the attack and after sometime will hit the pause button.<br/>
- We can see that we don't have the permission to login so will copy it and go into the Options Tab<br/>
 and can see that there is a GREP - Match option<br/>
- So we can flag that we could not login in realtime and see if we can login in or not.<br/>
- So this is the ART of crediential stuffing.<br/>
<br/>
- Now will see what is Password Spray ??<br/>
- It is the ART of using know user-names without a know password (i.e. Will use a default password for all account that could be Fall2022! or Tesla123@)<br/>
- And the only downside of using this technique is that we r targeting the Active Directory accounts and when we are attacking ADA we have to super <br/>
 careful because we could be locking them out without even knowing.<br/>
- So Always Ask Before You Attack how many attempts we have before we will be getting locked out a bunch of user's and cause Deinal of Service.<br/>
<br/>
- So whenever you see a login page always go for Default credentials because you never know..................<br/>
