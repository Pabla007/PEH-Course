<title> Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads</title>
</head><body>What is a Payload ??<br/>
- A Payload is what we will run as an exploit.<br/>
- Normally we send a Payload to a victim to get a shell access.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 types of Payload that we need to give our attention.<br/>
- Non-Staged Payload<br/>
- Staged Payload<br/>
<br/>
Take Away<br/>
- If we have a payload that doesn't work maybe try other type of that payload. <br/>
- If our payload fails but we think it's the write exploit maybe change your payload.<br/>
