<title> Attacking Authentication - Brute Force</title>
</head><body>Brute Force might seem like an easy concept, but a lot of people get frustrated Cuz they're not taking the right approach and thinking methodically.<br/>
<br/>
Tools we can use to pull of these attacks:<br/>
BurpSuite<br/>
FFUF<br/>
Hydra <br/>
<br/>
Keep in Mind when attacking live systems, it might be slow and wordlist should not be too huge. <br/>
We might also be blocked or lock accounts or cause instablity in our target.<br/>
<br/>
When we try with<br/>
Username : jeremy<br/>
Password : password<br/>

<br/>
1st method-logy with BurpSuite<br/>
<br/>
<img height="298" src="image 2.png" width="700"/><br/>
<br/>
Send the request to the intruder by pressing ctrl + I and set the payload to the password.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Will load the password of top 1000 passwords list from Seclist and give it a try and if it doesn't work will go with 100,000 but it's of no use as Burp Suite is Throttled and rate limited.<br/>
Will filter the result with the size and Volla we got the password<br/>

<br/>
2nd method-logy with FFuF<br/>
Will paste the request in a txt file and chage the password to a keyword = FUZZ<br/>
<br/>
Command: ffuf -request req.txt -W /usffuf -request req.txt -request-proto http -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt -fs 1814<br/>
