<title>Attacking Authentication - Intro</title>
</head><body>Authentication is a critical component of application security, and often basic attacks are overlooked.<br/>
<br/>
As many flaws are logic based which means we usually review the authentication flow and than come up with edge cases to break it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Difference B/w Authentication and Authorization:</b><br/>
Authentication:<br/>
Authentication is who you are ?_?<br/>
It's your identity (i.e. showing ur passport or your ID when you check into a hotel)<br/>
<br/>
Authorization:<br/>
Authorization on the other hand is what you're allowed to do.<br/>
SO once your'have checked into the hotel you get a card key and can use it to access your room and the pool <br/>
<br/>
2 Main Ways we're going to approach attacking Authentication:<br/>
1st will look into Brute force attacks something that lot's of development teams udnerestimate.<br/>
2ndly will look at the logic issues as they can turn out to be critical and probably 99% of the time undetectable by scanners and automated tools.</body></html>
