<title>Attacking Authentication - MFA</title>
</head><body>In particular the checklists are designed to not just give you a bunch of things:<br/>
Test this payload but....<br/>
<br/>
It's designed to kind of spark ideas. Think of different attacks and different approaches so that when you find a vulnerablity you have a better chance of exploiting it.<br/>

There are 2 approaches:<br/>
1st editing the username <br/>
2nd bruteforoce the mfa code as it's not that long from<br/>
000-000 to 999-999<br/>
<br/>
Will simply change the username to jeremy once the request is being intercept<br/>
we can either forward/drop/intercept to off and it will automatically forwards all the queued requests.<br/>

<br/>
I turn the intercept off my request goes with jessamy and not with jeremy as the mentor said.<br/>
