<title>Command Injection - Challenge Walkthrough</title>
</head><body>Ultimate Goal Is trigger something as :<br/>
whoami and prove that we have code execution <br/>
if want to take one step further and pop a shell that is great to<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to read the error msg carefully<br/>
The third payload worked from the Appsec notes<br/>
Commenting out the rest of a <b>command; ls -la # </b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Got the error when i was running this command:awk 'BEGIN {print sqrt(((100-100)^2) + ((200-500)^2))}'whoami<br/>
<br/>
<img height="96" src="image.png" width="650"/><br/>
<br/>
Will simply run the test data to see what's happening<br/>
So we should target the Position Y box <br/>
<img height="231" src="image 2.png" width="700"/><br/>
Command in Position Y : 10)^2))}';whoami;<br/>
But as we can see that we din't got the result <br/>
<img height="250" src="image 3.png" width="750"/><br/>
Will run this command: 10)^2))}';whoami;#<br/>
as we have added the # in the end if there is anyerror it would get resolve as no command will get exceuted after the # command<br/>
<img height="243" src="image 4.png" width="750"/><br/>
<br/>
So it's a basic injection let see if we can pop a shell out of this<br/>
