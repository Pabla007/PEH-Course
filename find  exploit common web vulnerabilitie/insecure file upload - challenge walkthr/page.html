<title>Insecure File Upload - Challenge Walkthrough</title>
</head><body>I was able to upload the png file successfully but can't say the same for the txt so let's check if the check's are happening at CS or SS<br/>
<br/>
<img height="259" src="image.png" width="800"/><br/>
<br/>
So the checks are happening at the Server Side.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily the file got upload with Null byte attack and didn't work with Magic Bytes<br/>
<img height="247" src="image 2.png" width="750"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to open the null byte but got the error<br/>
<br/>
I even tried to upload php5<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to upload <b><span style="background-color: #ffa300">logo1.phtml</span></b>and exceute as i was not able to execute the above file<br/>
<img height="213" src="image 3.png" width="550"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img height="97" src="image 4.png" width="700"/><br/>
<br/>
<img height="389" src="image 5.png" width="650"/><br/>
<br/>
