<title>SQL Injection - Blind Part 1</title>
</head><body>First will start the lab up from the docker:<br/>
to run the docker in the background than just add -d in the end.<br/>
sudo docker-compose up<br/>
<br/>
Open Web-browser <br/>
http://localhost<br/>
As i loggined in accidently and haven't started the foxy proxy so even though my burp suite was running i was not able to get the post request<br/>
<br/>
Mentor will introdue BurpSuite and Sqlmap and when as well as how to use it's feature<br/>
<br/>
Will set foxy-proxy as well as the proxy in the Burpsuite to <br/>
127.0.0.1 and port 8080<br/>
<br/>
Solution: clear the history along with the cache and cookies<br/>

<img height="532" src="image 2.png" width="950"/><br/>
<br/>
Will send the request to the repeater using ctrl + r<br/>
What repeater does ?_?<br/>
we can simply modify the request what we are sending and simply compare other responses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As we put wrong password we can see that it generated error (i.e. change in content lenght) and also we viewed in render in response code<br/>
<img height="374" src="image 3.png" width="700"/><br/>
<br/>
Than will try username = jeremy' or 1=1#<br/>
but will encode it using ctrl + u <br/>
username=jeremy'+or+1%3d1%23%26password=password<br/>
<br/>
Now we are in a tricky situation so let's see if we can automate this task and find the sql injection.<br/>
<br/>
On a live target Mentor says to reduce the number of requests as will get limited request like 3 to 5.<br/>
<br/>
<img height="333" src="image 4.png" width="700"/><br/>
<br/>
<img height="224" src="image 5.png" width="650"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now we have a choice do we go back to manual testing ?_?<br/>
Do we try and download a list of payloads and try and fuzz it overselves ?_?<br/>
<br/>
This application must be processing this cookie so whenever you think about SQL Injection think everything you're supplying to the application and how it might be used.<br/>
<img src="image 7.png"/><br/>
<img height="258" src="image 9.png" width="800"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img height="387" src="image 10.png" width="800"/><br/>
Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac1a1a88e11159957db' and 1=1#; <br/>
<br/>
So long story short we are able to manupilate the cookie and got the same response for the content length i.e. 1027 which is an indication for SQL injection.<br/>
