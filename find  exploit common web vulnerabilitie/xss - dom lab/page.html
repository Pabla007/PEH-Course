<title> XSS - DOM Lab</title>
</head><body>This is DOM based cross site scripting Cuz what happens is, if we look at the network tab here we just reload the page quickly.<br/>
<br/>
When we actually send information we can see that there is no request going and coming back to the server.<br/>
<br/>
As this is entirely happening locally and it's vulnerability within the client this is DOM based CSS.<br/>
<br/>
<img height="267" src="image.png" width="650"/><br/>
<br/>
&lt;script&gt; prompt(1) &lt;/script&gt;<br/>
but when we hit enter nothing happen's as there is no triggering effect that will call it so will try another script<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img height="278" src="image 2.png" width="650"/><br/>
&lt;img src=x onerror=&quot;prompt(1)&quot;&gt;<br/>
is a quite common payload when the document tries to load X it will throw an error and on the error we can execute some JS.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Re-direct the user to another website<br/>
Command : window.location.href<br/>
&lt;img src=x onerror=&quot;window.location.href ='' &quot;&gt;<br/>
