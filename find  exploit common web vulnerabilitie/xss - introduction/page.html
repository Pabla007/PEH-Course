<title>XSS - Introduction</title>
</head><body>It's actually a very flexible vulnerablity and can be used to chain other issues together.<br/>
In a nutshell, it lets us execute JS in a victim's browser and often gives us control over the application for that user.<br/>
<br/>
Three main types of cross site scipting: <br/>
Reflected<br/>
Sotred<br/>
DOM-based<br/>
<br/>

<b>Reflected:</b><br/>

Reflected cross site scripting is where the script you're trying to inject comes from the current HTTP request<br/>
You send a request<br/>
You get a response<br/>
That script is included in the response.<br/>
<br/>
It's somewhat limiting as you can only target yourself unless the payload is via the URI<br/>
<br/>
<b>Stored</b><br/>
<img height="430" src="image 2.png" width="500"/><br/>
Stored cross site scripting is much more powerful and the payload is stored in a database and than retrieved later.<br/>
<br/>
This allows you to attack other users and therefore the impact of <br/>
the vulnerability is much higher <br/>

DOM-based scripting is that the Client Side has some vulnerable JS that users untrusted inputs instead of having a vulnerability Server Side.<br/>
<br/>
This allows you to attack other users and therefore the impact of <br/>
the vulnerability is much higher <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Will use dev tools built into the browser to demonstrate and later on we'll actually have find a place where we can inject our code rather than just executing JS manually in the Client.<br/>
<br/>
Press Ctrl + Shift + C<br/>
<br/>
Command : alert(1)<br/>
is the most famouse cross site scripting payload that you will come across.<br/>
Avoid using alter(1) cuz of the changes in Chrome and also how often it's filtered and detected.<br/>
<br/>
Mentor recommend when u're testing for XSS either use print or prompt<br/>
<br/>
<b>LogKey: </b><br/>
function logKey(event){console.log(event.key)}<br/>
<br/>
document.addEventListner('keydown', logKey)<br/>
