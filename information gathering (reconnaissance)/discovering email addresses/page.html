<title>Discovering Email Addresses</title>
</head><body>Here we will learn how to verify someone's mail or how to get someone's mail in the first place. Will have many resources for it<br/>
<br/>
- <b>hunter.io </b>(<a href="https://hunter.io/">https://hunter.io/</a>)<br/>
As we have selected tesla so we have many results related to it. And we can see here is a certain pattern here (i.e. Most common pattern: {f}{last}@tesla.com )<br/>

In Discovering mail video we have to use 10 minute mail to login because it ask for work email so u will not able to login with normal email.<br/>
<br/>
-<b>phonebook.cz</b>( <a href="https://phonebook.cz/ ">https://phonebook.cz/ </a>)<br/>
Here will get more results than hunter.io and could use this email for credential stuffing and using password like summer2020! and see it if logs into any of these accounts.<br/>

<br/>
- <b>clearbit connect</b>( <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearbit-connect-supercha/pmnhcgfcafcnkbengdcanjablaabjplo?hl=en ">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearbit-connect-supercha/pmnhcgfcafcnkbengdcanjablaabjplo?hl=en </a>)<br/>
In order to use it have to installed the chrome extension for it. So we can see a pattern that tesla uses first inital and last name policy.<br/>

<br/>
<b>What is the process to hunt something down ?</b><br/>
- Start with a google search. (i.e. Who is in this role at this company if looking at a specific person at a company)<br/>
- Then will go to phonebook.cz or hunter.io to identify the formating of the email (i.e try not to burn the clear bits unless need to)<br/>
- After reaching at this point we can verify this mail through Email Hippo (i.e. <a href="https://tools.emailhippo.com/">https://tools.emailhippo.com/</a>)<br/>
Using <b>emailhippo</b>we can simply validate the mail without itneracting with the person of doing an investigation of a cilent so without interacting with<br/>
him we can validate his/her mail.<br/>

<br/>
- Last trick but not the least is <b>don't under-estimate</b>the power of <b>forgot passwords.<br/>
</b><br/>
<br/>
If somebody shows up in a data breach guess what that email address has been used in the past </body></html>
