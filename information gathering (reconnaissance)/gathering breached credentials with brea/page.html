<title>Gathering Breached Credentials with Breach-Parse</title>
</head><body><a href="https://github.com/Pabla007/breach-parse">https://github.com/Pabla007/breach-parse<br/>
</a><br/>
Here we have to install a breach parse written by heath in shell script and have to download a 41 gb file which contains passwords and user name.<br/>
After the download we have to pass 3 arguments as we haven't install it in opt folder. And remember that for me it worked using the terminal as root.<br/>
Otherwise it was giving me not able to find the directory/folder at the give location.<br/>

<br/>
Than we will find if there are any repeating passwords and user names and see what we can obtain from the data.<br/>
<br/>
Another website which is paid to do this Dehashed. Here also we could find the info giving the email , username , etc<br/>
<a href="https://www.dehashed.com/">https://www.dehashed.com/<br/>
<br/>
</a>After that we find any password in hash we can try to convert that hash using a website it gives a valid password or not. But the <br/>
website was down to some reason.<br/>
<a href="https://hashes.org/ ">https://hashes.org/<br/>
<br/>
</a>So the alternative to this is <a href="https://crackstation.net/">https://crackstation.net/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To install any .deb file (i.e. freedownload manager in our case) will use this command for installation<br/>
sudo dpkg -i filename</body></html>
