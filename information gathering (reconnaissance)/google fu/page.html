<title>Google Fu</title>
</head><body>What make's a really good pentester or anything in IT sector ?<br/>
- Is the ability to Google.<br/>
- Here is a blog on how to do advance level searching in google. (i.e. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/</a>) <br/>
<br/>
We will now see what is <b>Google Fu</b>?<br/>
- It is a advance level searching where we use specific phrases and keywords and do our searching.<br/>
- It's like a Jen the more we do the more we know how google macro functions and the more we become successfull in finding our query's.<br/>
<br/>
Like in our case for Tesla.<br/>
<br/>
- <b>site:tesla.com </b><br/>
here we will see all the websites realted to tesla.com<br/>
<br/>
-<b>site:tesla.com -www<br/>
</b><b>-site:tesla.com -www -ir (i.e. here ir means investor relation)</b><br/>
Here we have substracted the www and done the searching and got different results and find more and more sub-domains.<br/>
<br/>
Now what about filetype ?<br/>
- site:tesla.com filetype:docx<br/>
<img height="194" src="docx.png" width="400"/><br/>
<br/>
- site:tesla.com filetype:pdf<br/>
<img height="244" src="pdf.png" width="400"/><br/>
<br/>
Why are we searching all these file types ?<br/>
- We are in the seach of all the sensitive files out there.<br/>
<br/>
- So google is our absolute best friend. So before we ask anyone a question no matter how complex the problem is <b>Always to do a google search first</b>and<br/>
make sure we have done our research and than ask anyone and it is good to have that habbit.<br/>
