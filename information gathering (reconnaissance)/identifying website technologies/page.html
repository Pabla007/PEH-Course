<title>Identifying Website Technologies</title>
</head><body>- Now we will look at what a website is build with.<br/>
- So for that we will use a tool called builtwith.<a href="https://builtwith.com/">https://builtwith.com/</a><br/>
- It shows us all the stuff from what tech , widgets it runs or what kind of framework it runs.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
- Now there is another tools called wappalyzer firefox (i.e. extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/</a>)<br/>
- Wappalyzer is a more of an <b>active</b>type of a reconnaissence.<br/>
- But we don't believe it because we are not scanning anything here.<br/>
- We are just going to the website as a normal user would so for us it's still passive as we are not doing anything out of the Norm.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Now why it is important ? What is the need of identifying the tech ?<br/>
-It's important because if we know it's running php or drupal there could be a vulnerability between those.<br/>
<br/>
There is one more tool which is a builtin tool called <b>whatweb<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>And the syntax is<b>whatweb tesla.com<br/>
</b><b>- </b>It did pulled up an<b>ip address and php version as well as drupal version.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>- </b>So using more tools to our advantage gives us more infromation.</body></html>
