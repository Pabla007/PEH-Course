<title>Utilizing Social Media</title>
</head><body>- When we are surfing the social media we should look for the internship photos and in that we need to find the badge photos or desk pictures or anything of this sort.<br/>
- And a good employee is told to hide there badge photos<br/>
- Twitter is the gold mine for these kind of things. And in Linkedin we have to use the peeping account so that we don't trigger anything weird because otherwise if the user see's it that would be problem.<br/>
- And we don't have the membership so that we will not be able to see names but we have to remember the format of the nameing convention here as we have done in <br/>
website hunter.io.<br/>
- We coould also use scrapper to scarp all the employee names and transfer those initials to first name and last name. And could write a python script to do that if you would want to challenge to do that.<br/>
- The mentor bets the money that from the 34K employee there will be user who's password will be fall2019 or winter2019! or tesla1234!<br/>
- People are the weakest point of an organization and people will be lazy with there passwors unless the company told them to follow a certain password policy.<br/>
- People will be posting all the things all the times which they should not be posting but we have to just dig deep.</body></html>
