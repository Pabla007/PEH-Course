Steps To Conduct a Buffer Flow :<br/>
1- Spiking : Method that we are going to use to find a vulnerable part of a program And once we are able to find the vulnerable part of the program will do fuzzing.<br/>
2- Fuzzing : Similar to Spiking but here will send a bunch of character's at a program and see if we can break it.<br/>
3- Finding The Offset : if we do break it we want to find out at what point we did break it.<br/>
4- Overwriting the EIP : We could use that offset to overwrite the EIP (i.e. the pointer address)<br/>
5- Finding The Bad Character : <br/>
6- Finding The Right Module : <br/>
When we have information from 5 and 6 we can generate the shell code (i.e. Malcious shell code) that will allow us to get the reverse shell.<br/>
Using that will point the EIP to malcious shell code and hopefully will gain root.<br/>
7- Generating The Shellcode : <br/>
8 - Root<br/>
