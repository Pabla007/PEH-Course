<br/>
On the Victim Machine we have install 2 tools<br/>
- Vulnserver (on the victim machine we are going to run vulnserver which is the vulnserver that we are going to attack which will allow us the write a custom <br/>
exploit against this and will get a reverse shell)<br/>
<a href="https://thegreycorner.com/vulnserver.html">https://thegreycorner.com/vulnserver.html</a><br/>
Wasted a lot of time simply have to download the zip file and not to login and clone it.<br/>
<br/>
Turn off the Windows Defender Cuz it can block the download.<br/>
<br/>
- Immunity Debugger <br/>

</a>Remember that we have to STOP the security (i.e. Windows Defender and than install the software cux it was not letting me to open that )<br/>
When we are triggering different type of attacks than we can see how it's affecting the memory and the stack.<br/>
