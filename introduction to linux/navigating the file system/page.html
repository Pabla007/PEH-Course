<title>Navigating the File System</title>
</head><body>Everthing in Linux is Case Sensitive.<br/>
- If we want to see hidden files or folders that which command to run ?<br/>
i.e. <b>ls -la<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>We have seen how to use ls and cd without even going to the path Physically. <br/>
i.e.<b>ls Desktop/</b>even if our current directly is home.<br/>
<br/>
And also use<b>updatedb</b>frequently whenever we intend to use<b>locate</b>function.<br/>
<br/>
To update the password from default the command is <b>passwd.<br/>
</b><b><br/>
</b>To the documentation of any command use <b>man</b>command.<br/>
i.e. <b>man ls</b><br/>
<br/>
or even can use <b>ls -- help </b><br/>
<br/>
<b>!!!Beaware</b><br/>
If it looks like something's not there doesn't mean it's not there.<br/>
<br/>
If we want to write something in a file than we can use echo command<br/>
<b>echo &quot;Hi!&quot; &gt; test.txt</b><br/>
<br/>
if the file is not there and we use move command than it will create a file for us.<br/>
<b>mv text.txt Downloads/</b><br/>
<br/>
If want to locate any file than we have to use this command<br/>
<b>locate</b><br/>
<br/>
Use this command frequently to update the database before using the locate command.As it will<br/>
build the database of the information of it's finding in order to locate what's we are searching for.<br/>
<b>updatedb</b><br/>
