<title>  Common Network Commands
</title>
</head><body>In windows we use <b>ipconfig</b>but in Linux we use <b>ifconfig</b>but they both are pretty same.<br/>
<b>iwconfig</b>is for wireless connection and<b>ping</b>command as well as remember that <b>ICMP</b>is another word for ping.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<b>arp</b>command is used to show the ip address that talk to and mac address assosiated with it.<br/>
i.e. if an ip address reaches out and talked out to a machine it will say who r u ? and will broadcast this ip address and will say<br/>
who has this ip address than the ip address will respond hey i do and this is my mac address.<br/>

<b>so arp is simply assosicating ip address with mac address.</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>netstat -ano</b>command is used to see the active connections that are running on a machine.<br/>
If a machine is talking to somebody else and will be used in the penetration testing. For example if we open and browse something in firefox than<br/>
the infromation of the port being opend and used will be display here.<br/>
<br/>
<b>route - </b>There could be machine that we are attacking might have multiple routes so we might see a 134 and 135 because <br/>
it might have dual home nick means it is talking to completley different network that we did not know that existed.<br/>
So that is idea <b>pivoiting</b>where we switch networks from one to another.<b><br/>
