When we type the command <b>ls -la</b>than if we see the first line there are 2 things :-<br/>
1st is if it's an <b>hyphen</b>which means it's a <b>file</b>.<br/>
2nd is if it's a <b>d</b>which means it's a <b>directory.</b><br/>
<br/>
After than rwx (i.e read write exceute). Here we have 3 groups.<br/>
1- owner of the group (i.e. drwx)<br/>
2- Permissions for the members of the group that owns the file. (i.e. Ownership) (i.e. r-x)<br/>
3- normal users (i.e. r-x)<br/>
<br/>
<b>chmod</b>is used to change the mode that is permission of the file.<br/>
And will use chmod 777 as it will give us the read write execution persmission.<br/>
<br/>
cat /etc/passwd will show all the users to us.<br/>
cat /etc/shadow will provide us the password.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody can change the persmission in the sudoer's file if they are the sudo users. <br/>
<br/>
As tmp folder had full read write execute permission.Will load some exploties into the temp folder during the penetration test <br/>
<b>ls -la /tmp/</b><br/>
<br/>
To add a user in Linux we have to use this command <b>adduser username<br/>
</b>and to switch b/w the normal user and root user we have to use this command: <b>su username</b></body></html>
