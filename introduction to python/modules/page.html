<title>Modules</title>
</head><body>THere r some module that we have to import before we can see the functions. <br/>
As not every module is built in.<br/>
i.e sys is system module or os is module which we will use more frequently in the course.<br/>
<br/>
import sys<br/>
import os<br/>
import datetime<br/>
<br/>
or could import a specific module rather than importing it all.<br/>
<br/>
from datetime import datetime<br/>
as well as we could also import with alias i.e.<br/>
from datetime import datetime as dt<br/>
