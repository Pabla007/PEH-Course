We have 2 options for it.<br/>
First is simply writing <b>python3 first.py</b><br/>
<br/>
Second is by exceuting <b>./first.py</b>but to run it this way we have to decalre she bang at the top of the file.<br/>
<b>#! ./bin/python3</b><br/>
So this is simply tell that we have to run it in python3 and the location of it is bin.<br/>
<br/>
If we want to open the file and not want to close before running the program for that the code is <br/>
<b>gedit first.py&amp;<br/>
<br/>
