<title>IP Addresses</title>
</head><body>- We have solved the issue of shortage of ipv4 with <b>NAT</b>(i.e Network Address Translation ) using private ip address. <br/>
- So with single Class C public ip adress we can use upto 254 devices (i.e number of hosts per network).<br/>
- IP address are layer 3 protocols (i.e <b>layer 3</b>is a router) as we are talking about routing here.<br/>
<br/>
Command to check the IP address in Linux is :<br/>
<b>ifconfig</b><br/>
<br/>
