<title>Exploit PHP</title>
</head><body>Will login in the website and see different options and surf the website to find some loop holes and exploits in it.<br/>

<br/>
-As we can see that there is a upload a file option here. <br/>
- So we can attack a website or what are some ways we can get code execution.<br/>
- Will try to absure the file uploading system and see if we can upload a reverse shell and get a connection back.<br/>
<br/>
Open Google<br/>
Search : php reverse shell<br/>
Website : <a href="https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php">https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php</a><br/>
<br/>
So will open the raw and copy all the content and paste it into a file name shell.php<br/>
<b>command : mousepad shell.php or nano shell.php<br/>
</b>Change the ip address in their (i.e. 192.168.142.128 in this case our ip address and not the attacker's ip)<br/>
Cuz we are trying to make reverse shell attack so the victime will send us a shell and will be listing for it.<br/>
<br/>
- Now will establish a listner<br/>
command : nc -nvlp 1234<br/>
<br/>
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]<br/>
└─# nc -nvlp 1234<br/>
listening on [any] 1234 ...<br/>
connect to [192.168.142.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.142.131] 34830<br/>

We were able to get a reverse shell but we are not a ROOT user. So we have to a privilege escalation here.</body></html>
