What is Mentor's Strategy ??<br/>
- When we see port 22 we immediately erase it from the board. It doesn't mean that we can't attack it. We can attack it using bruteforce.<br/>
- Usually in CTF's that not the intended route.<br/>
<br/>
But as a Pentester we have to bruteforce it to check <br/>
- if there's a weak password or not.<br/>
- Can i login in as root with a weak password or not.<br/>
- Number 2 if our client pick us up or not. (i.e. do they detect us when we run bruteforce attack)<br/>
<br/>
PORT 80 <br/>
- if we search 192.168.142.131 on a web-browser we can see a default page.<br/>
- Why is this page even out there ? Is it meant to be out there ?<br/>
<br/>
So now we will look at the FTP<br/>
Command : ftp 192.168.142.131<br/>
anonymous<br/>
anonymous<br/>
<br/>
Command : ls<br/>
Command : get note.txt<br/>
