<title>Dns Port 53</title>
</head><body>As we know that dictory bursting is not the entry point so will look into the dns <br/>
Will use a tool called Dnsrecon <br/>
<br/>
Command : dnsrecon -r 127.0.0.0/24 -n 192.168.205.134 -d blah<br/>
where r is for range (i.e. scanning the local host)<br/>
n have to provide the ip address of the box that we are looking for<br/>
d for domain <br/>
<br/>

[*] Performing Reverse Lookup from 127.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.255<br/>
[+]   PTR blackpearl.tcm 127.0.0.1<br/>
[+] 1 Records Found<br/>
<br/>
As there is dns record named blackpearl.tcm and have to add that in our Dns and etc/hosts file<br/>
Command : nano /etc/hosts (i.e. we have to add the edit the hosts file and not host)<br/>
And add <br/>
192.168.205.134 blackpearl.tcm and save it <br/>
Close the browser and rerun the web page to get this output <br/>
<br/>
Webroswer : http://blackpearl.tcm/<br/>

<br/>
Will again give a try to directory bursting (i.e. will run ffuf and see if we are able to discover anything)</body></html>
