<title>Scanning and Enmeration</title>
</head><body>From the above 2 capstones we know that we have to do <br/>
Arp scan and Nmap scan<br/>
<br/>
And seeing the results in the Nmap scan we can surely know which ports to looks and which ports not to look<br/>
For example in this case will leave the port 22 (i.e. SSH cuz we don't have the credentials)<br/>
<br/>
Will target Port 80 , 2049 &amp; 8080<br/>
<br/>
Port 2049 (i.e. nfs that is Network File Share and think it like SBM file sharing )<br/>
2049/tcp open nfs_acl 3 (RPC #100227)<br/>
<br/>
i.e. I think will be able to mount here</body></html>
