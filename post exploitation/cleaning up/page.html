<title>Cleaning Up</title>
</head><body>Cleanup is from a pen-test perspective here:<br/>
The overall goal of the cleanup is to make sure that you leave the network the same as it was when you entered it.<br/>
<br/>
Example: if you're adding any executable or any scripts or any files to a machine make sure you delete all of those files.<br/>
<br/>
if added any malware/rootkits or added user accounts for persistance please remove all those.<br/>
