<title>File Transfers Review</title>
</head><body>We as an attacker will host a file in the typical way that we like to host files is with python <br/>
<br/>
We can simply rdp using the certutil.exe in windows but for some reason that we can't use certutil.exe or maybe it is getting blocked by windows defender and it's suspicious<br/>
<br/>
But both Linux and Windows have FTP features so we can simply host the windows FTP and host up our attacker machine.<br/>
<br/>
And last Honourable mentions that's not even on this list:<br/>
Metasploit has the upload and download feature and very easy to use it.<br/>
