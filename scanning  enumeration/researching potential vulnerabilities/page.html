<title>Researching Potential Vulnerabilities</title>
</head><body>- Will target the low hanging fruits.<br/>
- 80 &gt; 443 &gt; 139 &gt; 445 are the juicest of all.<br/>
<br/>
-Now we have to research the finding's <br/>
80/443 - Potentially vulnerable to OpenLuck (<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764">https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764</a>, <a href="https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck">https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck</a>)<br/>
- The exploit database is not gona work as the exploits are little dated so will use the github link that will actually work.<br/>
<br/>
- If we look at website with CVE details (i.e. the score) and will find if something is RED which is more critical <br/>
and not there no remote code execution for this Apache httpd 1.3.20.<br/>
<br/>
- We got <br/>
 Samba 2.2.8 Remote Code Execution<br/>
 Samba 2.2.x Remote Buffer Flow <br/>
 Samba trans2open <br/>
Will go with RAPID7 because they built the metasploit and much detail is given about the vulnerability is given with how to do it with steps.<br/>
139 - Potentially Vulnerable to transopen (<a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/samba/trans2open/">https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/samba/trans2open/</a>, <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7">https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7</a>, <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10">https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10</a>) <br/>
<br/>
And if we don't want to use google for some reason and want to use a tool if we don't have internet access or we have not research base capabilities.<br/>
- Tool Name is searchsploit and we can't be too specific with search sploit.<br/>
<b>command : searchsploit Samba 2.2.1a</b><br/>
will not results or will this instead<br/>
<br/>
<b>command : searchsploit Samba 2</b><br/>
- From the reseult we can say the trans2open is coming many times so it's looking Juicy.<br/>
- And we can do the same with mod ssl 2 <br/>
<br/>
- I have also research for webalizer version 2.01 but was not able to find anything so far.<br/>
- But there are some attach for OpenSSH 2.9p2 but my advise is whenever we use searchsploit always search 2 time.<br/>
 1st time with the specific Version and 2nd time with not specific version.<br/>
