<title>The Five Stages of Ethical Hacking</title>
</head><body><span style="font-size: 10pt"><b>The five stages of Ethical Hacking :- </b><br/>
- Reconnaissance (i.e Active vs Passive)<br/>
- Scanning &amp; Enumeration (i.e. Nmap , Nessus , Nikto , etc.)<br/>
- Gain Access (i.e. Exploitation)<br/>
- Maintaining Access<br/>
- Covering Tracks<br/>

<b>So what is Reconnaissance ?</b><br/>
- This stage is also called as information gathering. And it has 2 different types (i.e. Active &amp; Passive).<br/>
<br/>
- Passive is like going out to google and search client details on twitter , linkedin and we are not doing anything active there<br/>
as we are not doing anything on the client website.<br/>
<br/>
- Active Reconnaissnance kind of falls with the second phase and scan actively using tools to find open ports , vulnerability and different items as what returns on this result of <br/>
when we do the scanning.We also perfom what is called enumeration.<br/>
<br/>
<b>So what is Scanning &amp; Enumeration ? (i.e. Nmap , Nessus , Nikto , etc.)</b><br/>
Enumeration is just looking at some item and digging into to them to see if we can find out anything of value.<br/>
Eg. If a web server is running on port 80 and we see if port 80 is open and running a patchy 1.2 which is really really outdated.<br/>
And then we will google and see if patchy 1.2 has any exploits for it and we will do research.<br/>
<br/>
<b>So what is Gain Access (i.e. Exploitation)</b><br/>
One we have gather the information and done with the scanning &amp; enumeration part than comes the ganing access part.<br/>
Here will run the exploit against the client or against the vulnerable service to gain the acccess into a machine or network or environment etc.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What is Maintaining Access ?</b><br/>
And once we have that acccess the proccess start to repeat we do scanning &amp; enumeration again and we also want to maintain that access.<br/>
eg. If we got kicked out once the user has shutdown the machine how do we maintain the access once the user has turn the machine back on.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What is Covering Tracks ?</b><br/>
Want to delete any logs that we leave behind or delete any kind of malware that we upload which is more important as a pentester. <br/>
Any accounts we had create for any reason and want to delete those as well.<br/>
We really want to clean up</body></html>
